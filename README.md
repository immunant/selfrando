# Immunant `selfrando`

Software written in C and C++ is exposed to exploitation of memory corruption. Compilers and operating systems include various exploit mitigation mechanisms that prevent certain offensive techniques. Unfortunately, standard mitigations lag behind the offensive techniques used in exploits against browsers, servers, and other frequently targeted software and do not stop a well-resourced adversary.

`selfrando` can be used to harden your software beyond what is possible with current mitigations. Inspired by biodiversity in nature and existing randomizing defenses, `selfrando` varies the attack surface, i.e., the code layout, by randomizing each function separately. This makes exploit writing harder and increases resilience to information leakage relative to traditional address space layout randomization (ASLR) techniques.

## Features

- **Low-overhead** `selfrando` has an imperceptible effect on program initialization and runtime performance. When using the SPEC CPU2006 suite suite, `selfrando` adds less than a 1% overhead to most of the benchmark running times.
- **Load-time randomization**. Binaries built with `selfrando` are all identical on-disk because the code layout is not randomized until it is loaded into main memory. This means that protected programs can be distributed just like traditional programs and can use the same cheksumming and signature tools too.
- **Easy to use** No changes to build tools or processes are required. In most cases, using `selfrando` is as easy as adding a new compiler and linker flags to your existing build scripts.
